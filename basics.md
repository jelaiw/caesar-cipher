When encrypting a message, *plaintext* refers to the unencrypted message and *ciphertext* to the encrypted message. A cipher is composed of two functions: *encryption* turns a plaintext into a ciphertext, and *decryption* turns a ciphertext back into a plaintext.

You can think of a cipher (in encryption mode) as **E**, taking as input a plaintext, *P*, and a key, *K*, to produce a ciphertext, *C*, as output.
