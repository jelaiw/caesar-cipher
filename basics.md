When encrypting a message, *plaintext* refers to the unencrypted message and *ciphertext* to the encrypted message. You can think of a cipher as composed of two functions: *encryption* turns a plaintext into a ciphertext, and *decryption* turns a ciphertext back into a plaintext [1].

Consider a cipher (in encryption mode) **E**, taking as input a plaintext, *P*, and a key, *K*, to produce a ciphertext, *C*, as output.
