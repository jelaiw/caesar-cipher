When encrypting a message, *plaintext* refers to the unencrypted message and *ciphertext* to the encrypted message. A *cipher* is a method for garbling a message to make it unreadable: for example, by changing the order of the characters or by replacing some characters with different characters [4]. 

You can think of a cipher as composed of two functions: *encryption* turns a plaintext into a ciphertext, and *decryption* turns a ciphertext back into a plaintext.

Consider a cipher encryption function **E**, taking as input a plaintext, *P*, and a key, *K*, to produce a ciphertext, *C*, as output.
